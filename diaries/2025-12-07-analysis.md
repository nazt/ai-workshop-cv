# Session Analysis: 7 Dec 2025

## Working Style

### Nat
- Gives requirements incrementally, not all upfront
- Immediate, direct feedback ("not cool!", "too short")
- Prefers asking over guessing
- Uses tools well (gh, git, issue workflow)
- Mixes Thai + English

### AI (areas to improve)
- Ask requirements upfront before starting
- Don't guess - ask first
- Know platform limitations before doing

## Key Lessons

| Topic | Lesson |
|-------|--------|
| GitHub Markdown | Use bullet list for multi-line |
| GitHub Issue | Short + user's language + enough context |
| Communication | Direct is better than sugarcoating |
| Workflow | Plan in issue → execute |
| Documentation | AI reads it → write in English |

---

## Feedback Loop Example

Issue formatting took 3 rounds:

| Round | Nat said | AI did |
|-------|----------|--------|
| 1 | - | Wrote long issue (English) |
| 2 | "too long, Thai please" | Too short |
| 3 | "add more context" | Just right! |

**Lesson:** Ask "How long? What language?" upfront → done in 1 round

---

## What Worked Well

- Used issue to plan before execute
- Separated LESSONS.md as central reference
- Changed to English (AI reads it)
- Organized directory structure

---

## Improvements for Next Session

| Problem | Solution |
|---------|----------|
| Didn't ask requirements | Ask: Git? Issue? Language? Format? |
| Didn't know GitHub quirks | Read LESSONS.md before writing markdown |
| Trial and error many rounds | Preview/test before commit |

---

## One-liner

> Ask first, do once, be direct, read LESSONS.md
