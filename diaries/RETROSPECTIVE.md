## Example: Sprint 1 (7 Dec 2025)

**Date & Time**: 7 Dec 2025 · 14:50 - 15:43 (GMT+7 Bangkok)

### What Went Well

- Nat knows exactly what he wants
- Direct feedback loop - immediate iterations
- Used GitHub workflow properly (issue → execute → close)
- Organized directory structure quickly
- Created LESSONS.md to prevent repeating mistakes

### What Didn't Go Well

- Took 5 commits to fix GitHub markdown formatting
- Didn't ask requirements upfront
- Trial and error with blockquote vs bullet list vs table
- Should have previewed before committing

### Lessons Learned

- GitHub markdown: use bullet list for multi-line, not blockquote
- Always ask: Git? Issue? Language? Format? upfront
- Read LESSONS.md before writing markdown
- Include timestamps with timezone always
- Plan in issue before executing

### Action Items (Next Sprint)

- [ ] Read CLAUDE.md and LESSONS.md before starting
- [ ] Ask all requirements upfront
- [ ] Preview markdown on GitHub before committing
- [ ] Use short codes for faster communication
