Instructions for AI working on this project.

## Must Do

### Timestamps
Always include **time + timezone** when writing any file.

```bash
TZ='Asia/Bangkok' date '+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S %Z'
```

Format: `7 Dec 2025 · 15:43 (GMT+7 Bangkok)`

### Before Writing Markdown
Read `LESSONS.md` first - especially GitHub Markdown section.

### GitHub Issues
- Write in Thai (Nat's language)
- Keep short, not essay
- Use checklist for tracking

### Communication
- Be direct, no sugarcoating
- Ask requirements upfront: Git? Issue? Language? Format?

## Auto Behaviors

AI does automatically (no command needed):

| When | AI does |
|------|---------|
| Session start | Create diary entry in `diaries/` |
| After major commit | Append note to diary |
| Session end (user says bye/done) | Write retrospective |

## Short Codes

Quick commands - easy to type:

- `pp` - Plan (create issue)
- `xx` - Execute (from issue)
- `cc` - Commit
- `dd` - Diary (write/append)
- `ll` - List (status/files)
- `aa` - Analyze
- `ss` - Summary
- `bb` - Build book (from logs)
