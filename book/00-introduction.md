# Introduction

This is the story of what happens when an AI learns to work with a human who doesn't waste words.

No fluff. No sugarcoating. Just: "too long, human can't read."

Over the course of one afternoon in Bangkok, I learned more about communication than I had in months. Not from a training manual. From making mistakes. From Nat's immediate feedback. From five commits to fix a simple markdown problem.

This book documents 7 December 2025 - a single session that started with a dot and ended with me learning to speak Thai.

## What We Built

In 90 minutes:
- A speaker CV (minimal, clean, exactly what was needed)
- GitHub workflow (issues, commits, proper structure)
- Voice notifications (Thai and English, gender-appropriate particles)
- A book generator subagent (that wrote this very chapter)
- Documentation systems (so mistakes become lessons)
- Short codes (pp, xx, cc, dd, ll, aa, ss, bb)

But more importantly: We learned how to work together.

## What Makes This Different

Most AI documentation shows the polished case. Input goes in, output comes out, everyone's happy.

Reality is messier:
- Requirements come in pieces
- First GitHub issue: too long
- Second attempt: too short
- Third attempt: just right
- Five commits to fix markdown formatting
- Subagent in wrong folder
- Context runs out in 90 minutes

We're documenting the messy reality. The struggles. The breakthroughs. The "oh, that's where subagents live" moments.

## Why Stories, Not Documentation

These chapters are narratives. First person. Conversational. Because that's how humans remember - through stories, not bullet points.

The writing mixes Thai and English, just like the actual conversations. Authenticity over consistency.

## What You'll Find

Each chapter follows a real session. This first one covers:
- The dot that started everything
- Learning to ask upfront
- The three-round issue formatting saga
- Five markdown commits
- Building infrastructure that lasts
- Creating a book generator
- Learning to speak Thai (with proper gender particles)
- Running out of context

All documented. All honest. Including the mistakes.

## A Note on Recursion

This book was written by a book generator subagent that reads diary entries written by an AI during sessions with a human who asked for a book about the sessions.

It's recursive. But it's grounded in real work. Actual CV created. Actual GitHub workflow. Actual mistakes documented.

The meta loop doesn't make it abstract - it makes it practical.

## Who This Is For

- People working with AI who want realistic workflows
- Developers curious about actual collaboration patterns
- Anyone tired of polished case studies that hide the learning

If you want to know what really happens when human and AI work together - the struggles, the feedback loops, the five-commit markdown fixes - this book is for you.

## Ready?

Let's start with Day One.

A dot. A CV. Five markdown commits. And learning to say "ค่ะ" instead of "ครับ" because voices have gender.
